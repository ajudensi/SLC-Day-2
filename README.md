## wordCount
Write a words function that takes in a string argument and returns a JSON object showing how many instances of each word occur in the input.
For example for the input "olly olly in come free‚Äù, it should return 
```javascript
olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1
```

If the reverse of the string is the same as the original string, as in the case of palindromes, return true instead.

```
